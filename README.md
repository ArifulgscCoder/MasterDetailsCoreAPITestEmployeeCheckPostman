Description: A Master-Details Core API CRUD Application About Employee is an ASP.NET Core Web API project that manages employee data along with associated details, such as job history, projects, or dependents, using a master-details structure. In this case, the Employee entity serves as the master, while related entities (like JobHistory, ProjectAssignments, or Dependents) act as details.

Key Features:
Employee Management (Master):

CRUD Operations: Create, read, update, and delete employee records, with fields such as EmployeeID, Name, Position, Department, and HireDate.
Details Management:

Job History: Stores records of an employeeâ€™s previous positions, departments, and durations within the company.
Project Assignments: Tracks the projects an employee is or has been assigned to, with details like ProjectID, Role, and Duration.
Dependents: Manages dependents associated with an employee, including details like DependentName, Relationship, and DateOfBirth.
Each detail entity has CRUD Operations to add, update, view, and delete associated records for each employee.
Cascade Operations:

When deleting an employee, cascade delete or update options can be implemented to manage related records in job history, projects, or dependents.
DTOs (Data Transfer Objects): Create DTOs to transfer data for both employees and their associated details, optimizing data transfer and hiding sensitive information.

Tech Stack:
ASP.NET Core Web API: For creating RESTful endpoints to handle CRUD operations on employees and related details.
Entity Framework Core: For managing relationships between Employee (master) and related details tables (JobHistory, ProjectAssignments, Dependents).
Database: SQL Server, PostgreSQL, or MySQL for structured storage of employee and related data.
Swagger (optional): For API documentation, testing, and easy interaction with endpoints.
Example Use Cases:
Employee Job History: Allows HR to track all previous job roles, departments, and duration of each position held by an employee.
Project Assignments: Helps project managers view and manage employees' involvement in different projects.
Dependents: Assists in maintaining records of dependents for benefits and insurance purposes.
This project is ideal for understanding master-detail relationships, entity navigation properties, and the practical application of CRUD operations in ASP.NET Core Web API for comprehensive employee data management.
